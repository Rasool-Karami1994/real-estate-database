# react - cart
An application that simulate parts of an online shopping website cart.


Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.

 I build an application that allowed users to search and remove products and increase or decrease the number of them. and user can  apply the filters based on the product packaging .

I used react and Css for building this project And  I practiced and used the concepts of costuom-hooks, Context, useReducer hook and conditional rendering for render the components.
